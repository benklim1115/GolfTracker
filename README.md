# GolfTracker
This repository contains my final capstone from Tech Elevator. Here we had to create a full stack application, we made the front end using HTML, CSS, and Vue.js. The backend was made using Java and a Relational SQL database as well as utitlizing a google map API to track our golf course locations and putting pins on them. The app allows you to track your golf scores from a list of over 12,000 public golf courses in the United States. When you add your score it displays your scores by your most recent time you golfed. It also shows all registered users top scores in a leaderboard on the home page as well. You can also find golf courses on the Find Golf Course page by searching the name or part of the name and then the API uses latitude and longitude of the courses in our database to place a pin of where the course is located.
